# Surfs Up Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose of Project
In this project, I demonstrated my proficiency with various using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy to filter the date column of the measurements table in the database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June and December. Then I converted those temperatures to a list, created a DataFrame from the list, and generated the summary statistics. 
### Background of Project
I plan to open a surf supply and ice cream shop on Oachu. After putting together a business plan, I reached out to W. Avy, an investor, and he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Summary 
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. 

In order to mentor the next generation, Pewlett-Hackard should consider expanding mentor requirements. Additional queries to consider:
* Would expanding the mentor requirements from 1 year to 3 years or 5 years be able to match at least 10% of retiring employees? 
* Rather than age or in addition to age, should Pewlett Hackard consider years of experience in the given job title as requirement for mentorship?
