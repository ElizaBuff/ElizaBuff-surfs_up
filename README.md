# Surfs Up Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose of Project
In this project, I demonstrated my proficiency with various features in SQL including: entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), creating new tables with into statements, exporting a CSV file, filtering queries, using join, on(), order by, and using aliases. To accomplish these goals, I was given a fictional situation and data set of six CSV files. 
### Background of Project
Pewlett Hackard, a large company with thousands of employees, is looking toward the future in two ways: (1) offering a retirement package for those who meet certain criteria and (2) identifying which positions will need to be filled in the near future. The objective of this project is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program, and a written a summary analysis report to prepare Pewlett Hackard for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December.

## Summary 
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. 

In order to mentor the next generation, Pewlett-Hackard should consider expanding mentor requirements. Additional queries to consider:
* Would expanding the mentor requirements from 1 year to 3 years or 5 years be able to match at least 10% of retiring employees? 
* Rather than age or in addition to age, should Pewlett Hackard consider years of experience in the given job title as requirement for mentorship?
